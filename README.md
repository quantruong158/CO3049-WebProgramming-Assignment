## Assignment specifications

Create a calendar for the patients to make an appointment with a medical doctor
In this assignment, you are required to design and build a web-based system for the patients to make an appointment with a doctor.

- Users: doctor and patients
- The doctor logins to the system, creates a calendar where he can mark the time slots as available or busy
- The patients login to the system, see the whole calendar with available and busy time slots. The patients can then pick up one time slot to make an appointment with the doctor. The system sends E-mail to notice the doctor and the patent information about the appointment. The system gives the patient the possibility to change the appointment later, and the same procedure can be repeated.

Notes: time slot = 30 minutes.
